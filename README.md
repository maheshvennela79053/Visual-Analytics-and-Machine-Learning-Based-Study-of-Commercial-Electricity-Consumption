Energy consumption analytics project applying machine learning models to commercial electricity data for prediction, classification, and consumer segmentation.
# Machine Learning and Visual Analytics of Commercial Electricity Consumption

## 📌 Project Description
This project applies machine learning and data visualization techniques to analyze commercial electricity consumption data provided by TG-NPDCL for October 2025. The goal is to predict consumption, classify users, identify important features, and segment consumers based on usage patterns.

## 📊 Dataset
- Organization: TG-NPDCL
- Sector: Commercial
- Time Period: October 2025
- Data Type: Numerical and categorical attributes

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing Steps
- Missing value handling using mean and mode imputation
- Label encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-test split (80:20)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
1. **Linear Regression**
   - Consumption prediction
   - R² score evaluation
   - Actual vs Predicted visualization

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Binary classification of consumers
   - Accuracy and confusion matrix heatmap

3. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Rule-based classification
   - Feature importance visualization

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Consumer segmentation
   - Cluster visualization using scatter plots

## 📈 Key Insights
